models_to_utc - Rails >= 2.1
=============

This plugin adds a "models_to_utc" method to your migrations that converts all legacy :datetime and :timestamp records in a model to UTC.  It also provides the "revert_models_to_utc" method for your down migration.  The method takes two arguments:
  1)  One or more models
  2)  The time zone that you are converting from - run rake time:zones:all|local|us for a list

So, if your application was originally developed for the Eastern US time zone, it will add 4 or 5 hours (depending upon DST) to each timestamp.

Migration Example
=================

class MyUtcMigration < ActiveRecord::Migration
  
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  class Cat < ActiveRecord::Base; end
  
  self.up
    models_to_utc([User, Dog, Cat], 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)')
  end
  
  self.down
    revert_models_to_utc([User, Dog, Cat], 'Eastern Time (US & Canada)')
  end

end
